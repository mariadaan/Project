#### Comments
They will have a space after the slashes and the first letter will be capitalized. Comments will be used above every part of the code, even if it may seem obvious.

_// The comments in my code will look like this_

#### Indents
d3.select dots will be lined up vertically

_d3.selectAll(".bar")_
  _.data(values)_
  _.transition()_
  _.duration(1000)_
  _.text("like this!")_

Tabs will be used for indentation, always just one tab per indent.

#### Spacing
Two blank lines between functions, one blank line between every other piece of code. Lines used for comments are seen as part of this code.

#### Variable and function naming
Variable names will be kept as short and clear as possible. When a two-word name is necessary, camelCase will be used. Function names have to show the function's purpose. CamelCase will be used for this as well.

_var colorScale_

_function makeMap_

#### Code grouping
In the root of the repository, my homepage.html file is located. In a separate folder, all JavaScript files are located.
